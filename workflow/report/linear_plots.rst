Per-sex differences in (A) heterozygosity and (B-D) genome coverage. Calculated along chromosome/scaffold positions according to the selected window sizes (bp). By default, the 50 largest scaffolds are plotted. If a list of chromosomes/scaffolds are provided in the config file ("chr_file" or "synteny_chr_file"), these are plotted.
