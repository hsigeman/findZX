Scatter plots showing between-sex genome coverage and percentage of heterozygosity differences. Dashed lines mark the genome-wide median across all genome windows. 

The first set of plots (page 1: A-C) show sex differences in genome coverage and heterozygosity across genome window. 

The second set of plots (page 2:D-F) show mean (Â± SD) sex differences in genome coverage and heterozygosity per chromosome/scaffold, calculated from the genome windows from A-C. The mean and SD values for each chromosome/scaffold are reported in `Output tables`_.

The last page (page 3) contain information on what files were used to generate this plot.
