Scatter plots showing between-sex genome coverage and percentage of heterozygosity differences. The chromosome(s)/scaffold(s) listed under "chr_highlight" or "synteny_chr_highlight" are coloured differently from others. 

The first set of plots (page 1: a-c) show data points for each window separately. 
The second set of plots (page 2: a-c) show mean (Â± sd) values for each scaffold/chromosome.
